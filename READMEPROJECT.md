Welcome.

User Experience (User stories, Site owner goals)
- Goal is to create a fast-food chain theme website.

Design Choices (Fonts, colour schemes, imagery, wireframes) explaining why you made those choices
- I like red.
- Most fast-food chain restaurants use the colour red as it is associated with food which will cause the nearby people to get hungry and buy food (from the restaurant).

Technologies used (Coding Languages, Libraries, Tools)
- Languages: HTML, CSS
- Tools: VS Code, GitPod, GitHub, 

Features (Features Implemented, Future Features)
- Future features, "Charity foundations", "Artshows", random things as most current fast-food chain try out new platforms to gain more customers and attention.

Version Control and Deployment (Git, GitHub, GitPod, how to clone/deploy)
- 0.1 foundation

Testing â€“ HTML & CSS validators, Lighthouse, User Story testing
